# hello-world
yet another repos


I'm Catterwall, people, just getting my feet wet here...

trying to learn how to use github, and do something useful with programming hopefully.
Although computer literate for decades and introduced to my first programming class way back in 1970, 
I am woefully ignorant and need to catch up!
